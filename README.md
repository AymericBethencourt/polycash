Hello, my name is Aymeric and for this hackathon, I decided to compete in the Polygon track on builduing a truly great donation app in the likes of Stripe Payment Links. I also haded a new unique feature to compete in the open track as well. So let's get started.

The app is running live on [polycash.net](https://polycash.net). Right away you can see the care that has been given to the design of the app. Inspired from the Stripe design, I wanted to make Polycash look clean and proffesional. Click "Create New Payment Link" and you will see a beatiful form to fill all the data.
